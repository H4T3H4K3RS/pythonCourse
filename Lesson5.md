## Basic methods of working with lists

## cheatsheet

Python provides several built-in methods for working with lists. Here is a Python cheat sheet for some common list
methods:

```python
# Create a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Access an element in a list
print(my_list[1])  # 2

# Modify an element in a list
my_list[2] = 5

# Add an element to a list
my_list.append(6)

# Remove an element from a list
my_list.remove(4)

# Get the number of times an element appears in a list
print(my_list.count(3))  # 1

# Get the index of an element in a list
print(my_list.index(2))  # 1

# Sort a list
my_list.sort()

# Reverse a list
my_list.reverse()

```
